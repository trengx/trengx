"Transformers Made Easy for IoT"

The Trengx platform is constructed using an open-source project as its foundation (GNU GPL License).


1. The Motivation

Transformers play a pivotal role in large language models like ChatGPT, as they allow these models to comprehend intricate contextual relationships within extensive word sequences and generate highly probable word predictions. This predictive capability makes transformers suitable for various sequential data types, including sensor and actuator signals, thus offering substantial benefits for IoT applications. Nevertheless, current transformer libraries are not ideally designed for IoT contexts, as they mainly concentrate on static, batch-based learning applications such as image and natural language processing. In contrast, IoT environments display dynamic, uncertain, and distributed characteristics, requiring real-time adaptive (incremental) learning and adaptable connectivity. IoT applications generate complex, time-varying correlated data streams that transformer models must efficiently process for optimal prediction and model predictive control. With the expected number of IoT devices reaching 29 billion by 2030, the Trengx platform aims to revolutionize the IoT industry by streamlining the incorporation of transformer technology into adaptive and interconnected IoT applications.


2. The Customer

Trengx serves a diverse group of IoT users, including engineers, developers, scientists, and researchers working in academia, government, non-profit organizations, and businesses of various sizes. These users can be involved in IoT sectors such as manufacturing, energy, transportation, logistics, retail, agriculture, environment, biopharma, and healthcare, where adaptive and connected IoT applications are critical. These clients frequently encounter various obstacles, including limited understanding of transformer and IoT technology, the complexity of setting up a cloud environment to collect a substantial volume of streaming data, and difficulties in building and training models at a large scale. Trengx offers a solution to these issues, enabling customers to focus on their core business goals. To further enhance the user experience, clients can participate in annual conferences and events where they can learn about different use cases and practical applications of the Trengx platform. By addressing these challenges and offering additional learning opportunities, Trengx creates a more accessible and valuable experience for its users.


3. The Value Proposition

Trengx's value proposition centers on establishing a strong reputation in various IoT sectors, with a focus on niche markets like healthcare IoT. This strategy takes advantage of the company's adaptive transformer and graph computation techniques, allowing for real-time adaptation to needs and changes without necessitating recompilation or redeployment, thereby significantly decreasing time-to-market. Trengx's pledge to support researchers and innovators, even in areas such as biodiversity and climate science that may have limited attention, is a crucial element of its value proposition. By collaborating with IoT platform and graph database providers, such as Microsoft and Amazon, Trengx intends to offer free resources to academic research labs and startups for piloting, which can lead to funding opportunities and stimulate innovation. While Trengx prioritizes open-source principles and selectively open-sources key components of its technology, it also plans to form strategic partnerships with industry leaders to improve its offerings and expand its market reach. Trengx's continuous evaluation of emerging AI models and techniques, while maintaining its focus on transformer technology, ensures long-term sustainability and growth. To address the challenges of scaling services across diverse industries, Trengx aims to develop modular, customizable solutions that cater to specific sector needs while providing high-quality performance and support to its customers.


4. The Innovation

Trengx's platform addresses the challenges of adapting in real-time and maintaining flexible connections in dynamic and unpredictable IoT environments. It utilizes an adaptive transformer that continuously learns and adapts its parameters without the need for recompilation or redeployment, setting itself apart from conventional methods. Traditional matrix computations in transformer libraries, like TensorFlow and PyTorch, are constrained by inflexible structures and tight coupling. In contrast, Trengx leverages graph computation, providing flexibility and granularity in calculations involving individual entities and their evolving relationships, making it well-suited for connected IoT applications. However, graph computation can be slow due to the typically large size of transformer models. The principal investigator has previously shown that models with adaptable parameters can significantly reduce model size and this insight will be further explored in this project [REF]. In Phase I, Trengx aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of its approach in IoT applications by developing a proof-of-concept artificial pancreas IoT system powered by transformer technology. This demonstration will highlight the improved prediction and control capabilities of Trengx's method compared to traditional techniques, opening doors for applications across diverse industries.
