Under Construction!

"Transformers Made Easy for IoT"

The Trengx platform is constructed using an open-source project as its foundation (MIT License).

1. Motivation

ChatGPT's transformer technology reveals the potential for IoT applications by capturing intricate relationships within data sequences. The versatility of transformers enables their application to a wide array of sequence data, such as sensor and actuator signals, unveiling immense potential for IoT applications. The true challenge of IoT involves (1) facilitating interaction among devices to create a complex, interconnected system, and (2) empowering each device or the entire connected system to learn and adapt over time. These smart and connected IoT applications generate data streams with dynamic auto-correlation and cross-correlation, and such intricate, time-varying correlations are anticipated to be effectively captured by transformer technology, resulting in optimal prediction and control. As the number of IoT devices is expected to reach 29 billion by 2030, the Trengx platform aims to revolutionize the IoT sector by streamlining research and development in transformer-based technologies.

2. Customer
