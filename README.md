"Adaptive Transformers Made Easy for IoT"

The Trengx platform is constructed using an open-source project as its foundation (patent-protected).


1. Motivation
Transformers play a pivotal role in large language models like ChatGPT by enabling them to comprehend intricate contextual relationships within extensive word sequences and generate highly accurate word predictions. This remarkable context or correlation-capturing capability of transformers extends beyond language processing to a wide range of sequential data, including sensor and actuator signals. This versatility brings significant advantages to IoT applications, facilitating accurate predictions and efficient control mechanisms that surpass existing knowledge and capabilities. In IoT environments, where the relationships between data elements can dynamically change over time, real-time adaptive learning becomes imperative. However, existing hardware accelerators like GPUs (Graphic Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) are primarily optimized for scenarios where data relationships remain fixed. While these accelerators prioritize speed through optimized matrix computations, they often lack the flexibility required to adapt to dynamic changes in real-time. Addressing this challenge, Trengx is committed to developing novel FPGA accelerators leveraging patent-pending graph-based recursion technology. This breakthrough allows for the creation of "adaptive transformers," effectively addressing the challenges posed by IoT applications. 

2. Customer
Trengx serves a wide array of IoT users, encompassing engineers, developers, scientists, and researchers from academic institutions, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and businesses of all sizes. Industries like manufacturing, energy, transportation, logistics, retail, agriculture, environmental management, biopharma, and healthcare stand to gain from the incorporation of adaptive IoT solutions. These clients often face multiple hurdles, including a limited understanding of transformer and IoT technology, the complexity of establishing a cloud environment to gather and process a significant volume of streaming data, and the challenges associated with performing complex computations at a large scale. Trengx offers a solution to these issues, enabling customers to focus on their core business goals. 

3. Value Proposition
Trengx presents a distinct value proposition based on its FPGA adaptive transformer accelerator, which is offered as FPGA-as-a-Service or FaaS. This cloud service capitalizes on graph-based recursion techniques that are presently under the process of patent approval. This approach delivers two significant values to customers. First, Trengx aims to surpass conventional prediction and control methods used for real-time applications by achieving a 5% prediction and control performance improvement, harnessing the power of adaptive transformer technology. Second, Trengx's adaptive approach eliminates the considerable time delay between model training and deployment commonly found in conventional transformer applications like ChatGPT. Through an iterative process of learning and execution that does not require repeated deployment, Trengx achieves near-instantaneous adaptability, reducing time-to-market. To foster collaboration and innovation within the IoT community, Trengx embraces open-source principles and selectively shares specific technology components. However, the company also recognizes the importance of safeguarding its core competencies through patenting. To expand its offerings and establish a strong market presence, Trengx strategically forms alliances with industry leaders in the IoT and FaaS sectors, including Microsoft, Amazon, Xilinx, and Intel. These partnerships provide Trengx with access to free trial resources for academic labs and startups, fostering innovation within the IoT ecosystem and creating potential funding opportunities.

4. Innovation
Trengx's innovation is driven by recognizing the limitations of existing hardware accelerators and the need for adaptive transformers in the IoT field. FPGA technology has evolved from standalone devices to cloud-enabled accelerators, such as AWS EC2 F1 instances and Microsoft Azure NP-series, known as FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS). Conventional usage of FaaS often prioritizes fast and efficient matrix computations. However, this fails to fully utilize the inherent flexibility of FPGAs, which is highly beneficial for real-time adaptations in dynamic IoT scenarios. To address this, Trengx develops FPGA accelerators that can adapt to dynamic changes in real time. This is made possible by Trengx's graph-based recursion techniques, leveraging the flexibility of FPGAs to allow runtime modifications to transformer models and enabling any architectural changes without disrupting ongoing computations. This introduces the concept of adaptive transformers, with practical applications in IoT environments. By leveraging cloud FPGAs, Trengx's approach brings new possibilities for high-demand IoT applications. Additionally, the ability to deploy cloud FPGAs to local edge devices ensures continuous performance, even without internet connectivity. Trengx's innovation is specifically designed for the IoT sector, providing crucial flexibility for real-time adaptations in a dynamic and unpredictable environment.
